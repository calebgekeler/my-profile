          <p>I am a Mid Michigan based Software Engineering!</p>
          <p>My educational experience is in Natural Resources so I am excited to dive into the overlap of evolving technologies and how they can be used to create positive global impact! I am specifically interested in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The potential for technologies to drive us away from fossil fuels</li>
            <li>Creating a more efficient and smarter energy grid</li>
            <li>A network that allows for universal access to the World Wide Web</li>
          </ul>

        <!--about me-->
        <section><a>
          <h2 class="center-align">About Me</h2>
          <p>My passion for sustainability has been a long road. My degree is in Natural Resources and Environmental Management. After I graduated, I dove into the job market and realized that the kind of work I wanted to do was all centered around engineering. Engineers are the ones driving the technologies and practices to create a more sustainable world.</p>
          <p>I chose to persue software engineering for many reasons, but primarily because it's a field I feel I am good at and have the greatest to contribute to. My previous work experience was in Civil Engineering, and though I thoroughly enjoyed it, Civil engineers by nature do not drive the technologies we use on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>If you are here looking to add a new person to the team, reach out! I am eager to jump into a team of developers and collaborate on large scale projects. Learning from one another and building a product that solves a complicated problem are qualities I am excited to find in a work environment.</p>
